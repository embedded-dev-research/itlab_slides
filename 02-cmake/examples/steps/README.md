# Step-by-step CMake Examples

Follow these incremental steps to learn/build from simple to advanced:

1. `01-hello-plain` — compile a single file without CMake.
2. `02-hello-cmake` — minimal CMake project for the same program.
3. `03-lib-cmake` — add a library and link it.
4. `04-targets-modern` — target-based CMake (PUBLIC/PRIVATE, cxx_std_20).
5. `05-deps-fmt-find_package` — use external dependency via `find_package` (fmt).
6. `06-testing-ctest-gtest` — add tests with GoogleTest and run via CTest.
7. `07-presets` — use `CMakePresets.json` for multi-platform builds.
8. `08-toolchain-arm` — cross-compile with a toolchain file (ARM example).
9. `09-install-cpack` — install/export targets and make a ZIP with CPack.
10. `10-visual-studio` — Visual Studio generator and tips for Windows.

Each folder contains a README with commands for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
