# CMake Examples

This folder contains cross‑platform examples aligned with the CMake lecture.

- `steps/` — incremental, step‑by‑step walkthrough (recommended start).
- `hello/` — minimal single‑target example.
- `modern/` — target‑based layout with library, tests, presets, and packaging.

See each subfolder’s README for OS/generator specific commands.
